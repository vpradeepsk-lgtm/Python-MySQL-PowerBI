📈 Example Insights from Dashboard</sign>

Vendors with high sales but low stock turnover indicate potential supply chain inefficiencies.

Brands like Jack Daniels No.7 Black are consistently top performers → suitable for long-term contracts.

Low-turnover vendors (e.g., Dunn Wine Brokers) may need renegotiation or replacement.

Targeted brands with low sales but high margins can be leveraged for premium positioning.
